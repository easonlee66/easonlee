## part one：作者简介 Author brief introduction
我是刚刚加入GitHub的菜鸟。 I'm a rookie who just joined GitHub.
## part two：项目简介 Project brief introduction
这是我的第一个项目，用于尝试GitHub的用法。 This is my first project to try out the use of GitHub.

尝试成功后，这个项目将更名为”stopwatch”，成为正式版。 After a successful attempt, the project will be renamed "stopwatch" and become the official version.

这个项目是我做的秒表。 This project is my stopwatch.

一开始写的main.cpp的注释、输出均为中文，可因为中文出现乱码，所以我不得不写一个no_random_Edition_stopwatch.cpp，注释、输出均为英文，解决了中文乱码的问题。  At the beginning, the notes and output of main.cpp were all in Chinese, but because of the disorder code in Chinese, I had to write a no_random_Edition_stopwatch.cpp, the notes and output were in English, which solved the problem of Chinese disorder code.

感谢[喊我MB的数字时钟](https://www.cnblogs.com/masterb/p/12269835.html)让我走上了写秒表这条路。  Thank [喊我MB's digital clock](https://www.cnblogs.com/masterb/p/12269835.html) for putting me on the road of writing a stopwatch.

更高级的版本（如用鼠标操作）敬请期待^\_^ More advanced version (such as mouse operation) please wait^\_^
