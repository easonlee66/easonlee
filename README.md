## part one：作者简介 Author brief introduction
我是刚刚加入GitHub的菜鸟。 I'm a rookie who just joined GitHub.
## part two：项目简介 Project brief introduction
这是我的第一个项目，用于尝试GitHub的用法。 This is my first project to try out the use of GitHub.

尝试成功后，这个项目将更名为”stopwatch”，成为正式版。 After a successful attempt, the project will be renamed "stopwatch" and become the official version.

这个项目是我做的秒表。 This project is my stopwatch.

一开始写的main.cpp的注释、输出均为中文，可因为中文出现乱码，所以我不得不写一个no_random_Edition_stopwatch.cpp，注释、输出均为英文，解决了中文乱码的问题。  At the beginning, the notes and output of main.cpp were all in Chinese, but because of the disorder code in Chinese, I had to write a no_random_Edition_stopwatch.cpp, the notes and output were in English, which solved the problem of Chinese disorder code.

感谢[喊我MB的数字时钟](https://www.cnblogs.com/masterb/p/12269835.html)让我走上了写秒表这条路。  Thank [喊我MB's digital clock](https://www.cnblogs.com/masterb/p/12269835.html) for putting me on the road of writing a stopwatch.

更高级的版本（如用鼠标操作）敬请期待^\_^ More advanced version (such as mouse operation) please wait^\_^

## part three 更新日志 Update log
|版本号 Version number|版本简介 Version introduction|
|:----:|:-----|
|t1.0|反应慢，计时有问题，但实现了鼠标操作（虽然这就是反应慢的原因，技术差的鼠标操作+有问题的计时=反应慢）Slow response, timing problem, but mouse operation is realized (although this is the reason for slow response, poor technology mouse operation + problematic timing = slow response)|
|t2.0|学会了kbkit，取消了鼠标操作，反应快了许多，但计时还有问题  Learn kbkit, cancel mouse operation, reaction is much faster, but timing is still a problem|
|t3.0|抛弃传统的sleep，使用clock来计时，解决计时问题 Abandon the traditional sleep, use clock to time, solve the timing problem|
|v1.0（t3.1）|修复了一些bug，并作为正式版发布 Fixed some bugs and released as official|
|v1.1|又删除了一些调试版残余（main.cpp已删除）Some debugging residual is deleted (main.cpp has been deleted)|
|v1.2|解决无法复位的重大bug Resolve major bugs that cannot be reset|
